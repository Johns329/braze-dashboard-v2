# Braze Dashboard v2 (Single-Page HTML)

This is a Streamlit-free version of the dashboard meant to be embedded directly into a Braze landing page.

## What it does

- Renders a single-page dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Loads `data/tables/*.csv` from GitHub (`braze-dashboard-cloud`)
- Uses locally-hosted (GitHub) vendor libraries (no CDNs)

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Braze landing page stub

Copy the contents of `stub.html` into your Braze landing page.
Update the `dataBaseUrl` / `dataVersion` values as needed.
